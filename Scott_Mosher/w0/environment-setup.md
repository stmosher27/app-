# Setting Up Your Programming Environment

Before you start to work on the prep course material, it is important
that you make sure that you have the tools to:
* Write and run Ruby code
* Communicate and collaborate with classmates and instructional staff

## Programming in the Cloud

You can get through the App Academy Prep work using only a web browser.
A lot of the hassle of configuration is taken care of automatically by
the tools we use, and programming in the cloud makes it easy for TAs
to review your code remotely.

The minimum requirements are:
* a modern web browser (we recommend [Google Chrome][chrome], but
  [Mozilla Firefox][firefox] is also acceptable).
* an active [Github][github] account.
* an active [Cloud9][cloud9] account, linked with your Github account.
  * Refer to our Cloud9 [setup instructions][c9-setup]
* an active [Slack](#slack) account (don't set this up until we send you
  an invitation to the App Academy team). You can either download the
  Slack client or simply use their browser app.

## Accessing the Exercises

You should also have all the  exercises downloaded. If you're working
with Cloud9, the setup instructions are in the reading above; if you're
working locally, you can enter
`git clone https://github.com/appacademy/appacademy-prep.git`
into your terminal to copy this repository.
