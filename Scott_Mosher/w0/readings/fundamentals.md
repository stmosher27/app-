# Fundamentals

In a little over three months you will be a software developer.
You are going to learn a ton in the coming weeks. To get the
most out of the course you need to develop some tools of the
trade.

The skills outlined in this document are not optional. Developing
them will make you a faster, more efficient programmer. You will
be able to write more code, debug faster, and study smarter. Students
who hone these skills before the course begins are at a huge advantage.

## Keyboard

You're going to be spending a lot of time in front of a keyboard. The
faster and more accurately you can get your thoughts into the text
editor the more productive you will be and the more you will learn.
It is also pleasure to pair program with a good typist and very
frustrating to wait for a slow one. Be a good partner.

Take this seriously. Set aside 15 minutes a day to practice. Your
primary goal is accuracy. Speed will come naturally with time.
**DO NOT** look at the keyboard while you type.

- [typing.io](https://www.typing.io): Free, designed for programmers. Start with the 'Ruby on Rails' exercises.
- [keybr](http://www.keybr.com/#!practice): General touch typing practice 

## Command Line

The command line gives you access to all the tools you need as
a developer in one convenient place. Even mundane tasks will make
you feel like a badass. Want to zip all the cat gifs more than 6 months
old into a single folder? Just a few keystrokes away.

## Pry

Pry is a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) that allows you to try out
snippets of code on the fly. This is your most powerful tool as a Rubyist.
You should always keep a Pry session running in a spare Terminal tab and
use it to test out ideas before adding them to your project.

- [Get started here](http://www.pryrepl.org). Watch the screencast
to learn the basic commands. Follow along with the video, typing the
commands in your own terminal to get them in your fingers.

## Byebug

Byebug is the defacto standard for debugging Ruby. The readings for
[W1D5][debug-article] will go into depth on debugging but it's never
too soon to start. The debugger is your best friend when it comes to
quickly pin-pointing problems in your code. Developers who can quickly
debug are highly sought after.

## Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io) is the text editor you will be using in class.
Get a head start by learning some useful keyboard shortcuts now. A
good strategy is to pick one or two shortcuts a day and go out of
your way to use them whenever possible.

## Keyboard Shortcut Cheatsheets

Print out these cheatsheets and tape them to the wall above your
workstation. These should be second nature by the time you start
the course and be sure to add your own additional shortcuts as
you learn them.
