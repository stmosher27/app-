# Preparing your Resume

Before you're ready to embark on your App Academy journey, you need to write
a first version of your resume. Crafting your resume is extremely important;
if you want an awesome job, your resume is what's going to first get your foot
in the door.

We're going to have you make your resume now so that by the time you make it to
the other side of the course, it'll be that much more polished.

Read this document in its entirety, and then set about to making your own
resume. Don't worry if it's not perfect. We'll perfect it once we get to
the job search curriculum.

**Once you're done with your resume, put it in the resume directory**, with
the filename as your first and last name (i.e., sally_jones.pdf). This will
ensure that you include it in the prepwork zip file you send to us!

#### We must have your resume on file before you come in on the first day!

Right now, don't expect your resume to be complete. A tech resume generally has
four parts: *projects*, *education*, *work experience* and *skills* (or
technologies/languages). Of course, you don't have your projects yet. You'll
have them once you complete the course.

**For now, just use empty bullet points for your projects and their details.** This
will be useful in limiting you to a realistic amount of space for everything else.

You don't have your skills yet either of course, but we'll tell you in the
a later section exactly what skills to list. (If you have prior *programming*
skills, list them as well. If you know R, mention that. Excel, on the other hand,
probably not worth listing.)

Check out Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [model résumé][glm-résumé]. At the bottom
there's a template to make your own résumé too. Gayle Laakman McDowell is the
author of [Cracking the Coding Interview][cracking-interview], a very popular
(and useful) book on coding interviews. You'll come to know it well.

Here are some [templates][drive-templates] to get you started.
**Change the font, color scheme, and layout before using them**. Employers
do not like seeing similar résumés.

Here are some example resumes from previous students:

* [Ami Hays][ami-hays-resume]
* [Dean Hu][dean-hu-resume]
* [Edmund Li][edmund-li-resume]

# Layout
* ONE PAGE ONLY
* Lots of whitespace
  * 1-inch margins on left and right

# Content

In the world of people, having a diversity of interests and experiences is a
beautiful thing. In the world of tech recruiting, expertise is much more
valuable. If you had various non-tech jobs before App Academy, choose them
carefully so you don't spread yourself thin.  

You don't want to leave out large chunks of time either. In general you can
include roles you held for over a year. Keep in mind that these become less
relevant as you go further back in time. If your previous job was not
tech-related, you need an extra good answer to anyone who asks you why you're
making this transition. One of their concerns will be that you're only in it
for the money.    

## Relevant Links

* Github
* Portfolio Site (make this a dead link for now if you don't have one; you will later)
* LinkedIn

Bonus (if they're good)

* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Quora

## Skills

List these skills, and any other relevant ones. But keep in mind, anything you list here is fair game in a technical interview.

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* React.js
* Flux
* SQL
* Git
* HTML
* CSS

Don't try to organize your skills by proficiency. Ie. Don't do this:    
    Proficient: Ruby, Rails, JS    
    Familiar: SQL, React

 That makes you look less confident. However it's ok to do this:    
    Ruby, Rails, JS, React, C (learning)

## Work

The difference between a compelling work history and a boring one is whether you
have identified the *results* of your work.

Lucky for you most work histories out there are in the boring category.
Candidates merely go through past jobs and list the responsibilities they had
at each one. That's basically useless because those responsibilities only make
sense to someone who knows how the company actually worked. Your reader cares
about success, not process.    

In other words employers care about the outcomes of what you did at past jobs.
Someone who can talk about outcomes is someone who a) made a difference at
their job, however small, b) cares about results, and therefore c) is likely to
produce results at their next job.    

Results don't have to be achievements. You don't have to oversee a company
turnaround or be named employee of the month for a year straight to earn a
selling point. Simply describing something that sounds like success is a big
plus. Consider the following blurbs.    

*Wrote scripts to test new product before shipping.*    

vs.    

*Wrote scripts to test new product before shipping. Achieved one test per feature, resulting in bug-free launch.*    

Who knows if that's a meaningful benchmark? Maybe there weren't that many
features. Or maybe the product still had bugs and they just didn't turn up
during the launch. The key here is that you get to frame it. Even when all you
did was "just your job", doing just your job often results in something akin to
success. By describing that succes, you position yourself as a winner and at
the very least make your résumé more interesting. If your readers aren't
impressed, at least they'll be thankful.    

Note: The extra sentence describing results takes more space. Two longer
bullet points that convey success are much stronger than four bullet
points that only describe process (no matter what portion of your
previous job you're leaving out).    

Second note: If you did coding-like technical things, talk about it. Whether
that be scripting, Excel analyses, financial crunching, whatever. Technical
experience helps smooth out the appearance of your transition into engineering.


## Education

**App Academy**

Now that you are an App Academy student, selling yourself requires you to sell
employers on the quality of App Academy. You also want to make sure employers
understand you are not a sucker who fell for a get-rich-quick scheme. In your
résumé, mention that App Academy is a 1000-hour coding school with admissions
rate below 5%, which teaching emphasizes coding style and best practices.

Here are some suggested bullet points for your resume. Mix them up a little,
so you don't sound the same as the next person.

* Rigorous 1000-hour web development course with <5% acceptance rate
* 1000-hour full-stack programming bootcamp with <5% acceptance rate
* Teaches full-stack web development: Rails, SQL, JS, React, TDD, algorithms,
  and programming best practices.
* Topics include: Rails, React, TDD, scalability, algorithms, OOP, coding style,
  single-page apps, and web development best practices.

Feel free to mix and match.

**College**

If you took CS-related courses in college, add a "Curriculum Highlights" section
under the name of your degree and list those courses. Linear algebra, statistics,
and Electrical Engineering courses are also relevant here.

Include your GPA if you graduated 5 years ago or less and if it's above 3.2. If
you studied a STEM subject or Econ, you can use your Major GPA if it is higher.  
(Note on GPAs: most employers won't care about them, but a few will. This is
just for them.)

## If you have neither a college degree nor relevant work experience
Many students have graduated from App Academy without a college degree
nor relevant work experience. They are now all employed. It might be
tougher to get through the résumé screening, but the tech industry is
famous for appreciating non-traditional backgrounds.

The key in this case is to make a strong personal impression. You don't
want the reader to come away thinking "OK they can code. But I have no
idea what else to expect from this person." You have to be creative.

* Have you ever done volunteer work?
* Do you have some interesting hobbies that would make you stand out?
* It'll also be important to write enthusiastic cover letters that show
  an interest in what the company does.

If it's the case, you can mention "Left college in good
academic standing for financial reasons / to pursue web development."
